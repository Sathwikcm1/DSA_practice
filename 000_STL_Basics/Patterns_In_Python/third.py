#FIXME: this is the third pattern given the stiver's sheet.

no = int(input("Enter the number of stars in the first row :"))
for i in range(no):
    print("* " * i)

#TODO: This will print the "*"s in right angled traingle way.
#NOTE: because i is multiplied into "*" it will be printed that many times we will be putting i, it means it will print 1 * in first row, as we get to second row it will print two times and so on.
